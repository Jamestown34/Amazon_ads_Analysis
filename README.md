## 📍 Overview

In digital advertising, every dollar spent should move the business closer to a sale. However, ineffective keywords and underperforming ads can quickly eat into profits. This project explores ad campaign performance data, revealing insights on high-ROAS keywords, wasteful spending, and underperforming terms — all aimed at optimizing ad strategy for better results.

The primary goal was to evaluate keyword performance based on ROAS (Return on Ad Spend), ACOS (Advertising Cost of Sales), and conversion efficiency, so as to guide smarter keyword investment decisions.

---

## 🎯 Objectives

- Analyze ad spend data to uncover high-performing and low-performing keywords  
- Identify keywords with high spend but no conversions  
- Highlight top ROAS and high ACOS terms for prioritization and review  
- Use Pivot Tables and visual dashboards to summarize campaign performance  
- Deliver actionable recommendations to maximize returns and minimize waste

## 📊 Dataset Summary

The dataset contained advertising metrics such as:

- Keyword  
- Impressions  
- Clicks  
- Spend  
- Sales Generated  
- ROAS (Return on Ad Spend)  
- ACOS (Advertising Cost of Sales)  

Challenges included missing values, high impression but low conversion keywords, and interpreting financial vs. performance metrics.

---

## 🧹 Data Cleaning & Transformation

To ensure accurate insights, data was:

- Cleaned for missing or zero values in sales and spend columns  
- Filtered to isolate keywords with zero conversions but high cost  
- Transformed into pivot tables for easy breakdown of performance by keyword  
- Sorted and formatted to highlight top ROAS and high ACOS terms  

---

## 📈 Insights & Key Findings

- Several keywords returned **ROAS values above 700x**, indicating excellent returns on minimal spend  
- Over **₦77.47** was spent on keywords that generated **zero sales**, revealing budget leakage  
- High-ACOS keywords showed poor efficiency and should be reviewed  
- Some keywords cost less than ₦4 but generated over ₦190 in revenue, representing major optimization opportunities  
- Keywords with high impressions but no conversions were flagged for refinement or suspension

## 📊 Deliverables

- A cleaned and categorized ad performance dataset  
- Excel dashboard including:
  - Top 5 ROAS keywords and their sales/spend values  
  - Top 5 high ACOS keywords  
  - Total spend on zero-conversion terms  
  - Pivot Table summary by keyword  
- Actionable keyword recommendations  

---

## 💼 Business Recommendations

Based on the analysis, the following steps are advised:

- **Increase spend on high-ROAS keywords**: Keywords with >100x ROAS should be scaled further  
- **Suspend zero-conversion terms**: Eliminate budget waste by cutting spend on non-converting keywords  
- **Monitor high-ACOS keywords**: Review keywords with high cost and low return for potential removal or creative rework  
- **Optimize listings for high-impression/low-conversion terms**: Improve ad copy or landing page for these terms  
- **Segment and track by performance tiers**: Group keywords by ROAS and ACOS ranges for easier strategy planning  

---

## 🚀 Next Steps

- Implement A/B testing for high-spend, low-conversion keywords  
- Integrate campaign performance into a live dashboard (Power BI or Tableau)  
- Predict ROI using time-series models or ML classification (if historical data grows)  
- Automate keyword performance alerts using Excel formulas or scripts

## 🙌 Conclusion

This project highlights the importance of turning advertising data into strategic decisions. By identifying which keywords drive results — and which ones drain the budget — ad spend can be optimized to increase efficiency and profitability.

It’s a clear example of how even straightforward tools like Excel, when used with analytical intent, can deliver powerful business insights.
